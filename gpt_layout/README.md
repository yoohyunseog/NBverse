=========

Purpose
- Scaffold for a new "GPT layout" UI that will host the novel composition features.

Structure
- index.html: Base layout page (header/sidebar/content panes) using Bootstrap 5.
- assets/css/style.css: Theme overrides and layout styles.
- assets/js/app.js: Bootstrap and page init script (hook points for future integration).

Next steps
- Port selected components from `novel_composition_new5.html` into this layout.
- Mount the chapter list, attribute list, and GPT sections in dedicated panes.
